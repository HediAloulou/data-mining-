------------------------In this project, aimed at predicting whether a patient has heart disease---------------

We developed two notebooks :
- Data_mining_heart :this notebook contains Incorporating all features. 
- Data_mining_heart_less_features :this notebook contains less features. 

 --------------------------------------------------------
 Additionally, we deployed the application on a web interface using pickle python library, enabling efficient predictions using our model, thereby enhancing its practical utility.
 - best_model_first.pickle : corresponds to the first notebook
 - best_model_second.pickle : corresponds to the second notebook

----------------------------------------------------------
hear.csv is our dataset , it includes 12 features + 920 samples
